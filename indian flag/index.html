            <legend><b>About Republic Day</b>
            </legend>
            Republic Day is a national holiday in India, when the country marks and celebrates the date on which the
            Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950, replacing the Government of India Act (1935) as
            the governing document of India and thus, turning the nation into a newly formed republic. The day also
            marks the transition of India from an autonomous Commonwealth realm with British Monarch as nominal head of
            the Indian Dominion, to a fully sovereign republic in the Commonwealth of Nations with the President of
            India as the nominal head of the Indian Union.
            <br>

            The Constitution was adopted by the Indian Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on
            26 January 1950 with a democratic government system, completing the country's transition towards becoming an
            independent republic. 26 January was chosen as the date for Republic day because it was on this day in 1930
            when the Declaration of Indian Independence (Purna Swaraj) was proclaimed by the Indian National Congress.
